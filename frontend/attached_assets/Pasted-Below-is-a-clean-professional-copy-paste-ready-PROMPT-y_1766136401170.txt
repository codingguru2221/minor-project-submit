Below is a **clean, professional, copy-paste ready PROMPT** you can directly give to **Replit AI** to generate the **FRONTEND ONLY** of your **Personal Expense Tracker** app.
I’ve structured it clearly, kept logic-level details (no backend), and aligned it with what you described 👇

## 🔥 PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI (FRONTEND ONLY)

**Project Title:** Personal Expense Tracker (Frontend Only)

You are a **senior frontend developer and UI/UX designer**.
Create a **frontend-only Personal Expense Tracker application** with clean UI, modular components, and scalable structure.

---

---

## 🧩 APP STRUCTURE (3 PARTS)

---

## 🔹 PART 1: DEMO BANK & ACCOUNT SETUP (Mock Data)

Create **mock data only**:

* Each bank account should contain:

  * Bank Name
  * Masked Account Number (****1234)
  * Account Type (Savings / Current / Loan)

  * Dummy Loan Info (if applicable)

Store this data in:

```
src/data/banks.js
```
